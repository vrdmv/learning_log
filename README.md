# learning_log
Learning log is a Django-powered web app, which allows the user to register, log in, create, save and track their logs for any topic they 
add.
In order to access learning log, the user has to make sure all files from the repository are properly downloaded and that they have the
virtualenv package installed on their system. After that, the following steps apply:

1. open the command prompt and navigate to ..learning_log\ll_env\Scripts 
2. type in "activate" and press enter ("(ll_env)" should pop up on the left side of the directory path in cmd)
3. without exiting the command prompt, navigate back to learning_log
4. type in "python manage.py runserver" and press enter
5. go to any internet browser and enter: localhost:800
